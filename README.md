# MiniMenuSPA
Binds a menu to javascript functions, create a single page application easily.
The only file you need is the MenuDrive.js file for your own use. The other files are a demo. The best is to download the zip file and extract the contents on your machine. One function in the demo requires PHP so you might get an error if PHP is not installed when you call that one function. 
A live example can be viewed at http://fandango.musickshandmade.com/pages/documentation. Compare the HTML display with the page source to get an idea of how MenuDrive.js can simplify a very complex WEB page!
